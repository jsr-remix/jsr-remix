# LICENSE

Alright, here's the deal.

### What you *can't* do:
- Sell this code
- Steal this code and claim it as your own

Rest assured if we catch you doing this we will be *politely* asking you to take it down. And if you don't, we'll ask again. But less politely.

### What you *can* do:
Everything else.

This license is informal by design. If you have any questions, create an issue on Github.
