# CONTRIBUTING

Here's the basic guidelines.
- **Don't commit the game itself.** For obvious reasons. The Dreamcast ROM, the HD version, JSRF, just don't.
- If you're fixing a bug, **document what it did, why it happened, and how you fixed it.**
- For commits, make a **pull request.** Don't just commit things willy-nilly.
- **Optional** but highly encouraged: Funny commit messages, because yes. "fixed funny bug that made dj k turn into a ragdoll" > "Fixed model skeleton glitching out."

yeah, thats about it
