# Jet Set Radio Remix

A recreation of the original Jet Set Radio!
Our goal is to create a game that plays exactly like the original Dreamcast release, with improvements.

Discord: [come suffer with us](https://discord.gg/XJ4RXbKfM8)

## To-Do
completed tasks will be ~~crossed out~~
- Get a recreation of JSR's physics
- Actually make the game presentable
- Recreate Chapter 2 entirely
- Polishing the game
- Create an installer
- Release!

## So, you wanna help? [(Contributing)](https://github.com/jsr-remix/jsr-remix/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
Here's the basic guidelines.
- **Don't commit the game itself.** For obvious reasons. The Dreamcast ROM, the HD version, JSRF, just don't.
- If you're fixing a bug, **document what it did, why it happened, and how you fixed it.**
- For commits, make a **pull request.** Don't just commit things willy-nilly.
- **Optional** but highly encouraged: Funny commit messages, because yes. "fixed funny bug that made dj k turn into a ragdoll" > "Fixed model skeleton glitching out."

## Questions that nobody asked but we're answering anyway
### What is this?

a *recreation* (not decomp or recomp) of Jet Set Radio. yes, we know JSR HD exists, but it was delisted so what the heck we might as well

### What are the differences?

minor differences here and there, the real changes are in Chapter 2 (the one with Grind Square) but you can play the original if you want (dont blame us if you rage quit)

### Do I need a fancy setup?

anything that works well with vulkan will probably run this well. we'll also have a version of the game that runs in OpenGL in case you have an Intel HD Graphics 3000 or something

### Is it done yet?

read the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/jsr-remix/jsr-remix/blob/main/LICENSE.md) before doing anything stupid.

### Will this be on Steam?
